A _project_ in the Prisma Data Platform is an organizational unit for your JavaScript/TypeScript application that uses Prisma ORM.

You use projects to manage:

* environments
    * GitHub repository and branch
    * database connection
    * Data Proxy region
* [members](/data-platform/members)
* [paid plan and billing](/data-platform/billing/plans-and-quotas)

In the Prisma Data Platform, you can [add projects](/data-platform/projects/add-project) with one of the following workflows to create new or import existing projects.

* [Create a new database application from a template](/data-platform/projects/add-project/create-new-project-from-template)
* [Import an existing application with an existing database](/data-platform/projects/add-project/import-existing-project-existing-db)
* [Import an existing application with a new database](/data-platform/projects/add-project/import-existing-project-new-db)

For each project, you can edit the project name and URL handle, and when you no longer need a project, you can delete it.

* [Edit project settings](/data-platform/projects/edit-settings)
* [Delete a project](/data-platform/projects/delete-project)
